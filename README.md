 ### Design Brief
 <p>My goal is to make a customisable database for pokémon. More specifically, a webapp for casual pokémon trainers to record and plan their future pokémon teams. The final objective would be to make dispensable links which call back to a specific team composition which a trainer has saved and can share. Although, this last feature may be outside of the scope of the training up until now.

 This is how the CRUD would be implemented:<br>
